This prototype was developed as a part of the hackathon (Oct, 20th, 2017 - Oct, 22nd, 2017) using HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 3.3.7 and JavaScript. 
The hackathon was hosted by IBM and UCL where the CS enthusiasts had two days to come up and develop an app that could encourage people to join the Transcribe Bentham project.
More details about the hackathon can be found [in the UCL blog](http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/2017/10/24/project-update-bentham-hackathon-weekend/).
