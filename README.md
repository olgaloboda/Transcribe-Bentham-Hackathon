This prototype was developed as a part of the hackathon (Oct, 20th, 2017 - Oct, 22nd, 2017) using HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 3.3.7 and JavaScript. 
The hackathon was hosted by IBM and UCL where the CS enthusiasts had a weekend to come up an develop an app that could encourage people to join the Transcribe Bentham project.
More details about the hackathon can be found [in the UCL blog](http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/2017/10/24/project-update-bentham-hackathon-weekend/).
